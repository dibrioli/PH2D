//! Lightweight value types used by `WidgetStore` and the dispatcher.
//!
//! Extracted from [`super::state`] as part of the post-M14 refactor
//! (Track E2). These types are pure data — no methods that touch
//! widget state; they only describe **what** the interactive layer is
//! looking at (a context-menu request, a sticky-note record, the
//! sub-control of a blender picker that was hit).
//!
//! Re-exported via `interaction::mod` so external call-sites
//! (`crate::interaction::ContextMenuKind` etc.) keep working without
//! edits.
